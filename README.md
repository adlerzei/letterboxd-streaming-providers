# Letterboxd Streaming Providers ![Logo](./extension/icons/logo_final_48.png) 

## What?
This is a extension for common web browsers coded using the WebExtensions API.

## Main Features
This extension adds a filter for some streaming providers (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) to [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), to make it possible for you to see, which movies are included in your streaming flat rate.

### How?
The extension uses the TMDb API for assigning the original movie titles to the English ones. Furthermore, the JustWatch API is used to provide the streaming information.

### Which browser to use?
The extension can be added into Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
