## What?
This is a extension for common web browsers coded using the WebExtensions API.

## Main Features
This extension adds a filter for streaming providers (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) to [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), to make it possible for you to see, which movies are included in your streaming flat rate.

### How?
The extension uses the TMDb API to access the streaming information that is provided by JustWatch.

### Which browser to use?
The extension can be added into Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

#### Chrome Web Store

#### Firefox Add-ons (AMO)
**NOTE:** The Firefox version is currently broken. The Chrome version is running fine but it is based on Manifest v3. Maybe someone can port the Chrome version back to Manifest v2. If you are interested in doing this, contact me.
